  \emph{Read \textbf{Chapter $0$} of Lessons in Play, and do \textbf{Problem $1$} at the end of the chapter.}

  \step
  Consider the position:

  \begin{enumalph}
    \item Draw the complete game trees for both \cram
      and \dom. The leaves (bottoms) of the tree
      should all be positions in which neither player can move.
      If two left (or right) options are symmetrically identical, you may omit one.

        % include game-graph.pdf
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{game-graph.pdf}
      
        \caption{Game Trees for Given Position in \cram and \dom}
      \end{figure}

    \item Who wins at \dom if;
      \begin{enumroman}
        \item Vertical plays first? \\
          Vertical can force a win by playing
          the second (middle) branch of the game tree.
        \item Horizontal plays first?
          Horizontal one unique move (third branch of the game tree),
          which sets up Vertical to win on the next move.
          Therefore, If Horizontal plays first then Vertical wins.
      \end{enumroman}
      
    \item Who wins at \cram? \\
      Whomever plays first in \cram can force a win
      by playing the second (middle) branch of the game tree.
  \end{enumalph}
\end{problem}
